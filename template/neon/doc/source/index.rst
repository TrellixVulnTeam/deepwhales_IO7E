:Release: |version|
:Date: |today|

|neo|_ is Nervana_ â€™s Python-based deep learning library. It provides
ease of use while delivering the highest performance.

Features include:

* Support for commonly used models including convnets, RNNs, LSTMs, and autoencoders
* Tight integration with our `state-of-the-art`_ GPU kernel library
* 3s/macrobatch (3072 images) on AlexNet on Titan X (Full run on 1 GPU ~ 32 hrs)
* Swappable hardware backends: write code once and deploy on CPUs, GPUs, or Nervana hardware

New features in this release:

* Fast image captioning model (matches CPU based NeuralTalk while ~200x faster)
* Basic automatic differentiation support
* A framework for visualization
* and `many more`_.

We use neon internally at Nervana to solve our `customers' problems`_
in many domains. Consider joining us. We are hiring across several
roles. Apply here_!
