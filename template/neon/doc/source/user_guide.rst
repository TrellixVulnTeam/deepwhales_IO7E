Installation
============

External Dependencies
---------------------

To install neon on a Linux or Mac OSX machine, please ensure you have recent
versions of the following system software (Ubuntu package names shown):

* ``python``, ``python-dev`` - We currently support python 2.7
* ``python-pip`` - Needed to install python dependencies.
* ``python-virtualenv`` - Needed to configure an isolated environment
* ``libhdf5-dev`` - (h5py) for callback hdf5 datasets
* ``libyaml-dev`` - (pyyaml) for YAML input file parsing
* ``libopencv-dev``, ``pkg-config`` - (imageset_decoder) optional requirement,
  used to perform decoding of image data

Though neon will run on a CPU, you'll get better performance by utilizing a
recent GPU (Maxwell based architecture).  This requires installation of the
`CUDA SDK and drivers <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`_.


Virtualenv
----------

A virtualenv based install is recommended as this will ensure a self-contained
environment in which to run and develop neon.  To setup neon in this manner
run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon.git
    cd neon
    make

The virtualenv will install all required files into the ``.venv`` directory.
To begin using it type the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    . .venv/bin/activate

You'll see your prompt change to highlight the venv, you can now run the neon
examples, or extend the code:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd examples
    ./mnist_mlp.py

When you have finished working on neon, you can deactivate the virtualenv via:

.. code-block:: bash

    deactivate


System-wide
-----------

The virtualenv based install is recommended to ensure an isolated
environment. As an alternative, it is possible to install neon into
your system python path.  The process for doing so is:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon.git
    cd neon
    make sysinstall


Anaconda
--------

If you use the `Anaconda <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index>`_
distribution of python, the virtualenv based install described above will not
work.  Instead the following sequence of steps should get you going, assuming
you have already installed and configured anaconda python.

First configure and actiavte a new conda environment for neon:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wleepang/sd-deep-learning/master/2015-12-02/neon-conda-environment.yaml
    conda env create -f neon-conda-environment.yaml
    source activate neon

Now clone and install neon, bypassing the Makefile:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon.git
    cd neon
    python setup.py develop

When complete, you can deactivate the environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    source deactivate
