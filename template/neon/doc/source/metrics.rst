Metrics
=======
These classes represent various performance evaluation functions that can be
employed to determine how accurate the learned model is against a given
dataset.

Misclassification
-----------------
.. autosummary::
   neon.transforms.cost.Misclassification
   neon.transforms.cost.TopKMisclassification

Computes the fraction of data samples that have been misclassified. Multiply by 100 to obtain misclassification percentage.


Accuracy
-----------------
.. autosummary::
   neon.transforms.cost.Accuracy

Computes the fraction of data samples that have been correctly classified. Multiply by 100 to obtain accuracy percentage.
